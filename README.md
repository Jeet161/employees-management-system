Diamond Number Pattern (Python)

This repository contains a Python program that generates a diamond-shaped number pattern based on user input. The program prompts the user to enter the number of rows and then prints a symmetric diamond pattern using numbers. It is implemented using basic loops and string formatting, making it easy to understand and suitable for beginners learning Python.

Sample output for input 4:

   1
  1 2
 1 2 3
1 2 3 4
 1 2 3
  1 2
   1


To run the program, make sure Python 3 is installed on your system, open a terminal or command prompt, and execute the following command:

python diamond pattern.py


After running the program, enter the number of rows when prompted.

This project is intended for practicing loop control, spacing, and number pattern logic in Python and serves as a simple example for understanding pattern-based problems.
